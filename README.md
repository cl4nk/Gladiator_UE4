Limitations and bugs:
---------------------

Sometimes dropped equipment fall under the ground when somebody steps on it.
Some rare randoms crashes. Also, if a server leaves the game, clients stops working (no crash, just a freeze).
Sometimes, not all Items (such as Hammer and Shield) are created, this happens only when packaging. In that case, it's needed to restart the map.
